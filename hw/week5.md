### Homework 5 

**This homework is one programming practice section due Sunday, and a few tutorials due Tuesday.**

#### Programming Practice (due Sunday, October 4, 2015)

**Assignment 1**: Starting from the Pong code in the Week 5 section of the [course repository](../README.md#week-5-wednesday-september-30-2015), choose two of the following changes to make:

1. Add a sound that plays when the ball bounces off a paddle, and another sound that plays when a player scores a point. The [SoundFile reference](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/SoundFile.html) may be helpful! ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png)

2. Add two more paddles: one each at the top and the bottom of the game board to create four-player pong! Add new keys to control them. ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png)

3. Increase the speed of the ball on every bounce from a paddle. ![hard](../img/hard.png)

4. Make the paddles ellipses instad of rectangles, and make the balls bounce off them in a mathematically accurate way. ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png)

5. Add a new ball every time a player scores a point. ![hard](../img/hard.png)

6. Add a third paddle, controlled by the mouse, that a third player can use ("God Mode") to mess with the keyboard-bound players. ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png)

7. Pause the game for a few seconds between levels; during that pause, highlight the missed ball and show the score in large text in the center of the gameboard. ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png)

8. After one player reaches 10 points, end the game in some way that allows for starting a new game. ![hard](../img/hard.png) ![hard](../img/hard.png)

As usual, make a new repository and place your code (with the `.pde` extension!) in it

#### Arduino & Electronics Tutorials (due Tuesday, October 6, 2015)

We'll start working with electronics this week! 

In preparation, do some research ahead of time on the basic concepts; enough to answer the questions below.

- **Assignment:** [email me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) ([jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu)) answers to the following questions:
  1. Why does lighting an LED require a closed circuit?
  2. Explain, in your own words, what **voltage** and **current** are.
  3. What is the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance?

In answering those questions, you may find the following resources helpful:
