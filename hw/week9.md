### Homework 9 (due Sunday, November 1, 2015)

1. Final Project thoughts, due **Sunday**.

- Your final project will take up the bulk of your classwork for the rest of term. Think about what you'd like to do, and [send me](mailto:jzamfirescpereira@cca.edu) a 5-10 sentence description of what you'd like to do by **Sunday night, November 1**. Here are some thoughts:

  - Your project should have a significant programming component.
  - It should have some kind of input: maybe a sensor or two, a remote control, a touch control, a computer input -- perhaps through Processing?
  - It should have some kind of output: motors, LEDs, a Processing sketch, sound, video playback, a graph of data, etc.
  - It should have an artistic component.
  - It could have a mechanical component.

- Examples of pretty good projects include:
  - Laser Light Dance Floor: a repurposed DDR pad that controls music playback and a laser light show.
  - Lit Planters: a set of 3D-printed plants that respond to people walking around and interacting.
  - Piano player: molded plastic fingers, connected to servo motors with strings, that pull the fingers down to play an electric keyboard. Reads the MIDI format and plays music!
  - SensorBot: a wall-detecting robot that follows the walls in a room, measuring distance and light level as it goes.
  - Wall Drawbot: a wall-mounted pen controlled by an Arduino that can draw an arbitrary drawing, perhaps from an SVG file.

- Be creative! This is your chance to play with the concepts that excite you the most.

- We will likely go through a bit of a back-and-forth to refine your project idea -- the sooner you send it to me the more time you'll have to work on it!

2. Study for next week's in-class quiz! You may bring whatever notes you wish to the quiz, including the practice quiz. However, you may not use a computer!

  - [Email me](mailto:jzamfirescupereira@cca.edu) if you're confused by anything, or arrange a meeting with a lab monitor or programming coach in the Hybrid Lab.
